# MULTIPLE POINTERS PATTERN

the idea of this pattern is to have two or more pointers in a array or string, and move them in order to find a desired solution

here is an example

**problem description**

write a funtion which accepts a sorted array of integer. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined it a pair does not exist

**considerations** 

- the array must be integers
- the array must be sorted
