# FRECUENCY PATTERN

the idea of this pattern is to store in objects the frecuency of a collection of values.

here is an example

**problem description**

write a function that will take 2 arrays of integers, the second array must contain the square values from the first array,
the function will return true if every element in the first array has a corresponding square value in the second array, otherways it will return false

**considerations** 

- the arrays must be integers
- the arrays can or can not be sorted
- the arrays may be or may not be the same length
